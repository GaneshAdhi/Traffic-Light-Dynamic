#  Traffic Light Web App

##  Project Overview
The **Traffic Light Web App** is a dynamic and interactive web application that simulates a traffic signal—cycling through **Red**, **Yellow**, and **Green** lights either automatically or via user clicks.  
Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**, this app demonstrates state management, DOM manipulation, animations, and responsive design.

##  Features
- **Color Switching**: Lights change in real-time—either automatically or on user interaction.
- **Interactive Controls**: Optionally include buttons to cycle or directly select a light.
- **Visual Highlight**: The active light appears bright, while inactive ones are dimmed.
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS effects for fluid visual changes.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully adjusts across devices using Bootstrap.

---

##  Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Semantic and structured markup for clarity and maintenance.
- **CSS3 + Bootstrap** – Styling, centering, and responsive behavior.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Controls light state transitions and interactivity.

##  How to Run the App
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Either watch the lights cycle automatically or interact using controls (if implemented).
4. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser or viewing on different devices.
